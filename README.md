üß© Project Overview

This project implements an AI-based Sudoku Solver using three distinct techniques from Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) theory:

* Brute Force Search ‚Äì Tries every possible combination until it finds a solution. Simple but inefficient.

* CSP Backtracking ‚Äì Uses recursive backtracking to fill cells while checking constraints, reducing invalid states early.

* CSP with Forward Checking + MRV ‚Äì Enhances backtracking with:

* Forward Checking: Eliminates invalid future options after each assignment.

* MRV (Minimum Remaining Values): Selects the most constrained variable first, reducing the search space dramatically.

 
 # üß© Sudoku CSP Solver


This project implements a Sudoku solver in Python using three different strategies:
1. **Brute Force Search**
2. **CSP Backtracking**
3. **CSP with Forward-Checking and MRV Heuristics**

Developed for **CS480 - Artificial Intelligence** at Illinois Institute of Technology.
